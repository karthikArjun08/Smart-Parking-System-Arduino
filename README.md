# 🚗 Smart Parking System using Arduino

This project demonstrates a simple and efficient **Smart Parking System** using **Arduino UNO and Ultrasonic Sensors**.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- 2 × HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors
- 2 × Red LEDs
- 2 × Green LEDs
- Resistors (220Ω)
- Jumper Wires
- Power Supply

## ⚙️ Working Principle
- Each parking slot is monitored using an ultrasonic sensor.
- If a vehicle is detected within a threshold distance:
  - 🔴 Red LED turns ON (Occupied)
- Otherwise:
  - 🟢 Green LED turns ON (Available)

## 🧠 Applications
- Shopping malls
- Parking lots
- Smart cities
- Colleges and offices
